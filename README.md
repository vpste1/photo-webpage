<h1> Photography Portfolio PoC </h1>

<p> A small SPA to host photographs. Upon loading, interfaces with the Google Drive API to discover directory structure and children photographs. Links built based off folder names, and images gracefully displayed only upon loading. </p>
<p> Latency issues present due to time taken to load images from Google Drive. Moving to AWS on the horizon </p>

<h2> TODO: </h2>

- Finalise testing
- Handle failures with retries and more graceful feedback
